## Project topics

Project topics will be published here.
If you have ideas for a different project, please talk to us.


For each project you have to 
- read a research paper
- present the research paper to the class
- create a high-level model/simulation of the system/attack in your paper
- create a report including some simulations results from your model.

## Groups

The project should be done in groups of 2.
By September 21st please tell Arian by email who is in your group and what project you plan to work on.

If you have good reasons to work alone, talk to us about that.

## Presentation
All groups are expected to present their project to the class on Thursday 29th September.
By that time, you should have read the paper and be able to present some ideas on what/how to model.

## Collaboration
Each group needs to write their own code and report. However, talking to each other is of cause encouraged.

## Report
You need to hand in a report for your project. 
Code should be published on github.
The report should explain some background and show and explain your results.
You can also explain what you may add to your project, if you had more time.
The report should not exceed 10 pages latex article.
Alternative you could also hand in a jupyther notebook.

## Grading
The project will be graded based on the report.
Grading criteria are:
* Show understanding in the report.
* Extend of modeling/simulation.

While no simulation leaves nothing to explain, it is more important that you show that you understand results and assumptions you achieve, than that you have extensive simulations.
